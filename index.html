                <h1>Welcome to Capstone Cloud Services </h1>
                Capstone Cloud Services are an SME cloud service provider. The aim of the business is to provide personal and corporate level cloud services to users who have little to no understanding of the cloud. <br><br>
The company provides three main services: Storage, Web Hosting, and Bespoke packages.
The storage service allows users (either personal or corporate) to securely store all types of documents in the cloud. The service is powered by AWS S3. The service is similar to Dropbox or Google Cloud.

        A bespoke website is one that is designed and built for a specific set of users or purpose. This is the opposite of a theme or off-the-shelf website, which is a ready-made design. Website themes are a great way of getting your business online, especially if you are on a budget.<br> <br><br><a href="bespoke-packages.html" class="btn"> Learn more </a>
